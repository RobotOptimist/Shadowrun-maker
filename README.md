Shadowrun-maker
===============

create a character maker for Shadowrun

This was my first project ever in C#. I was trying to make a character maker for a role playing game called Shadowrun.

Unfortunately, my skills were not up to the task. While some progress was made, and some lessons were learned, I 
struggled mightily to make progress. Every decision I made was questioned. It was a very insecure development process.
One issue was that I used a lot of copy paste code. I did not follow any set of standards aside from my own intuition and
I didn't really understand the MVVM pattern, which appears to be the assumed underlying pattern for most UI projects in C#.

That said, this project set me down the path of enlightenment. It's true that I defected to Ruby development, but my love
of C and the C family of languages abides. 

Were there friendlier resources for learning C# I'm sure I would have preferred that. But when I began my journey, there 
were few beginner friendly C# tutorials aimed at assisting adults who wanted ot learn the language. My inquries also met
with surprising resistance from enterprise devs who tend to view the non CS degree developer as inferior. The Ruby 
community tends to be a bit more open minded as it regards non-CS degree people who have come to love CS and development.

Attitudes continue to change, including my own. I've already located pockets of .NET devs who are very welcoming, kind and
mentoring toward us wannabes. 

Well, this is more a blog post than a description of this software, but that's appropriate as this abandoned project is 
non-functional and should be re-done.

I do intend to redo it. It will be my senior thesis project for my Rails development course. It will be very challenging,
but worthwhile.
